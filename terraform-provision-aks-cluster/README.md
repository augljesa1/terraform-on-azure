# Learn Terraform - Provision AKS Cluster

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide for deploying Kubernetes on Azure using Terraform. It covers the process of setting up the necessary infrastructure, configuring Azure resources, and deploying a Kubernetes cluster using the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). By following this guide, you can quickly and reliably provision a Kubernetes environment on Azure for your containerized applications.

Prerequisites:

Azure subscription: You need an active Azure subscription to provision resources.
Azure CLI and Terraform installation: Install the Azure CLI and Terraform on your local machine.
Basic understanding of Kubernetes and Terraform: Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes concepts and Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code tool.



Infrastructure Setup:

Creating an Azure Resource Group: Create a logical container called a resource group to hold Azure resources.
Provisioning an Azure Virtual Network: Set up a virtual network to isolate and connect the resources within the Kubernetes cluster.
Configuring a Network Security Group: Define network security rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Creating a Storage Account for Terraform State: Create an Azure Storage Account to store the Terraform state, which tracks the infrastructure's current state.



Deploying the Kubernetes Cluster:

Defining Variables and Providers in Terraform: Configure input variables and specify the Azure provider for Terraform.
Creating a Kubernetes Cluster Configuration: Define the basic configuration for the AKS cluster, such as its name and location.
Specifying Node Pool and Cluster Properties: Configure the desired node pool properties, such as VM size and node count.
Configuring Azure AD Integration: Integrate the Azure Active Directory (AD) to enable RBAC and authentication within the cluster.
Enabling Network Policies: Optionally enable network policies to control traffic flow between pods.
Reviewing and Applying the Terraform Plan: Generate and review the Terraform execution plan, then apply it to create the Kubernetes cluster on Azure.


Clean-up and Deletion:

Scaling Down or Deleting Node Pools: Reduce or remove node pools based on resource needs.
Deleting the Kubernetes Cluster: Delete the AKS cluster to release Azure resources and stop billing.
Removing Azure Resources: Clean up the remaining Azure resources created during the deployment.


This documentation has provided a comprehensive guide for deploying Kubernetes on Azure using Terraform. By following the steps outlined here, you can create a fully functional Kubernetes environment with ease, enabling you to run and manage containerized applications efficiently. Remember to adhere to best practices and consider your specific requirements for customization and scalability. With Terraform's infrastructure-as-code approach and the power of Azure, you can streamline and automate the deployment of your Kubernetes clusters on Azure.
